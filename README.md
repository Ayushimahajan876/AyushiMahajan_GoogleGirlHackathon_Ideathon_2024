## Problem Statement 
In the face of growing environmental challenges, there is a pressing need to leverage AI technologies to monitor, analyze, and mitigate environmental issues. By harnessing the power of AI, we can gain valuable insights into environmental data, predict and prevent natural disasters, and promote sustainable practices. This will enable us to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to protect our planet for future generations. 
 Disaster Relief: 
Enhance disaster relief and response efforts by leveraging satellite imagery during disasters like floods and wildfires, integrating existing geospatial information, and utilizing environmental data for affected regions.


## Solution
Development of an AI model which takes the existing satellite imagery of the regions affected by wildfires and of those that are not affected by wildfire and  predicts the probability of occurrence of the wildfire. Since the model takes into account data of the existing imagery,it can be used to predict a disaster well before it happens and aid in the evacuation efforts. Moreover, It also takes the existing environmental conditions such as temperature,wind speed and humidity to predict the extent of wildfire i.e. spread of wildfire,and can predict the harm it can do based on current environmental conditions.After prediction,proper relief and response efforts should be done to enhance disaster preparedness by alerting the corresponding stakeholders so that proper measures can be taken on time.

## Wildfire Relief System 
I am leveraging satellite imagery to predict the occurrence of wildfires in the regions of Uttarakhand. After predicting the wildfires, I aim to utilize environmental data, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity, to assess the extent and spread of the wildfires in the affected regions.Additionally, I have developed a relief system that sends real-time alerts to nearby hospitals and police stations via phone numbers and notifies NGOs through email to facilitate timely and effective disaster response and relief efforts.
Until now,due to lack of wildfire relief management hectares of land have been affected.The primary objective of this initiative is to enhance disaster preparedness, response, and relief efforts in regions prone to wildfires as due to lack of disaster management as  it can lead to loss of plant life,human life and threat to nature.
This initiative is designed to benefit various stakeholders  involved in wildfire management and disaster response in the regions of Uttarakhand,including hospitals, police stations, and NGOs.By implementing this comprehensive approach combining satellite imagery, environmental data analysis, and an integrated relief system, I  aim to enhance the resilience and preparedness of the communities in Uttarakhand against wildfires and facilitate more effective and coordinated disaster response and relief efforts.
